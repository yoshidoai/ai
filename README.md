## 🪙 \$YOSH Token Launch (via Pump.fun)

To kickstart community involvement, Yoshido AI is launching a native utility token on **Solana** via [Pump.fun](https://pump.fun).

### 🎯 Token Utility

* Access to advanced AI features (e.g., longer videos, HD rendering)
* DAO voting on roadmap features
* Early creator reward system
* On-chain content verification and monetization in future releases

🧾 The `pumpfun-token/` directory contains launch info, CA metadata, and integration scripts.

🧪 We're open-sourcing our early integrations so you can build your own bots or tools using Yoshido's AI backends.
